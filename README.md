# ForecastPy

Small python app that predicts weather patterns using TensorFlow and Keras

## Why was this created:

Proof of concept: I want to have a good grasp on Machine learning concept and decided that this app would be a good place to fortify my knowledge. I also created this app with the intent of helping people get an approximate status on the type of weather they will be experiencing in their location.
